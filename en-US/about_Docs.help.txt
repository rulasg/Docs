SHORT DESCRIPTION
    `Docs` module will provide a framework to store documents on a file system based on filename and folder references.

LONG DESCRIPTION
    
    The lifecycle of a document could be described with the following steps

    1. Initialize the Stores if needed with `Reset-DocsStoresList`. By default it will initialize on first use.
    2. Add folders to Stores with `Add-DocsStore`
    3. Move to a store folder with `Set-DocsLocationToStore`
    4. Move Docs to Store folders `Move-DocsFile | Format-DocsMoveStatus`
    5. Find docs on stores with `Find-DocsFile`
    6. Test if a doc has a correct doc name with `Test-DocsFile`
    7. Rename a document with `Rename-DocFile`
    8. List Stores folders with `Get-DocsStore`

EXAMPLES
    Add a folder to the stores

    `Add-DocsStore -Owner "rulasg" -Path $rulasgDocStore -IsRecursive`

    All docs with the "rulasg" owner will be move to $rulasDocStore folder when calling `Move-DocsFile`

    NOTE
        -IsRecursive : sets the Find-DocsFile command to look for docs on the root and subfolders of the store folder. Default only looks on the root.

EXAMPLES
    Add a folder to the stores with target.

    `Add-DocsStore -Owner "rulasg" -Path $rulasgDocStore -IsRecursive` -Target "TargetName"

    All docs with the "rulasg" owner AND the "TargetName" target will be move to $rulasDocStore folder when calling `Move-DocsFile`.
    If Target is not specified "any" is assumed. "rulasg" owned docs will move if no other folder with it's target exists on stores folders.

EXAMPLES
    Rename a set of files with Docs name pattern

    `dir .\IMG-20200323-WA0001.jpg | Rename-DocsFile -Owner leo -what Seguimiento -Target Medico -Description Tabla_Cefaleas`

    You can check the parsing of the actual name with `ConvertTo-DocsDocName

    `dir .\IMG-20200323-WA0001.jpg | ConvertTo-DocsDocName | Format-Table`

    If you are still not sure use the `-WhatIf` switch on `Rename-DocsFile` to see the rename result without change

    `dir .\IMG-20200323-WA0001.jpg | Rename-DocsFile -Owner leo -what Seguimiento -Target Medico -Description Tabla_Cefaleas -WhatIf`
